# Navbook Notes

This is a project I am working on where you can find the nearest Gas station to your current location. It will also link you to your maps app of choice for easy directions. You can also set your favorite place to go and only display the nearest favorites.

Im hopeing I can make every user sign in and then ask for their location permissions one time, so then I dont need to have a popup every time they enter the site or app.
